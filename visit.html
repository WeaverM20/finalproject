<p>The Sherman Adams Visitor Center is available for people to visit everyday by reservation only. The reservation needs to be made to convey an arrival time, and your time in the center can only be for an hour. Pets are not allowed in the building and group sizes are limited to 6 people. The building itself not only houses the visitor center, but also has a cafeteria, restrooms, gift shops, the Mount Washington Observatory, and a museum. The visitor center at this time is closed for the season to the public, and will re-open at some point in May 2022. Due to this building being closed there is currently no services, amenities, or indoor shelters available for hikers and visitors at the top of the mountain.</p>

<h4>Mount Washington Observatory</h4>
<p>The observatory is the institution for a provate nonprofit that has a mission to understand more about weather and climate. The core piece of this place is the weather station, which is operated by two crews that alternate who conduct research, give tours of their facility, and take hourly observations of the weather. This observatory is known for maintinaing North America's longest continous climate records, and for conducting educational classes, learning programs, museum workshops, and conducting educational field trips of the facility. This institution also helps out visitors by giving continous updates of the weather conditions, so that people are able to know if they are able to visit the summit.</p>

<h6>Mount Washington State Park</h6>
<p>The Mount Washington State Park consists of 60.3 acres at the summit, and is surrounded by 750,000 acres of the White Mountain National Forest. Some of the views on a clear day from this park show spots that extend beyond the state of New Hampshire, and gives views of parts of Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine, Quebec, ad the Atlantic Ocean. This park also houses The Tip Top House which is adjacent to the summit. The Tip Top House is a historical building that was the second house built on the summit, and was originally supposed to be a hotel. After being used to house visitors and hikers it was eventually renovated into a historical site.</p>
